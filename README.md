## My first repository :heart: 

My favorite series is the Kdrama **"Our Beloved Summer"**. This is a heartwarming Kdrama that explores themes of *love*, *youth*, and *personal growth*.  It's a beautiful coming-of-age story that blends humor with *emotional depth*. I love it because of the on-screen chemistry between the leads is absolutely electrifying. Their relationship is full of tension, but also *genuine affection and humor*.

**Main Characters** :blue_heart:
1. *Choi U-ram* (played by Choi Woo-shik): A charming but somewhat aloof artist who struggles with his past.
2. *Kook Yeon-su* (played by Kim Da-mi): A smart, ambitious woman who has a tough exterior but is deeply caring and sensitive inside.
